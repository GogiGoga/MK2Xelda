levels128.h

//Add another SCRIPT_INIT constant that tells us where scripts start in memory. 
//So, we will have the first script start at SCRIPT_INIT + SCRIPT_0, and so on. 
//Well, these are the values ??that we have to put in the array of levels that 
//appears at the end of levels128.h:
//LEVEL levels [] = {
//	{3, 3, SCRIPT_INIT + SCRIPT_0},
//	{4, 4, SCRIPT_INIT + SCRIPT_1},
//   ...
//};

// The first number is the number of resource librarian that contains the bundle 
// of the level that is. As you can see, we started at 3. 
// The second number is the number of the music within the OGT that should sound or play. 
// Finally, we have the expression that calculates where the concrete script to start for each phase begins.
