HOW CAN I HELP YOU.
PLEASE HELP US. SOMEONE HAS STOLEN THE GOLDEN APPLE FROM OUR STATUE WHICH PROTECTED OUR ISLAND FROM THE MONSTERS. RESTORE THE APPLE TO THE STATUE.
TALK TO MY DAUGHTER SHE KNOWS HOW TO GET INTO THE DUNGEON.
BOO HOO. I HAVE LOST MY TEDDYBEAR. IF YOU CAN GET IT FOR ME, I WILL OPEN THE DUNGEON FOR YOU. SEE THE WOODSMAN.
YOU MUST CONQUER THE DUNGEON BEFORE YOU CAN GO NORTH. BRING BACK MY SCEPTRE FROM THE DUNGEON TO PROVE YOU HAVE CONQUERED THE DUNGEON.
I WILL HELP YOU WITH THE TEDDYBEAR. CAN YOU GET MY AXE FOR ME. I DROPPED IT RUNNING FROM THE MONSTERS. IT IS SOMEWHERE IN THE FOREST. I WILL OPEN THE GATE FOR YOU.
IT APPEARS THAT THE AXE HAS GOTTEN DULL. CAN YOU TAKE IT TO THE BLACKSMITH SO HE CAN FIX MY AXE.
I WILL FIX THE AXE, BUT I WILL NEED TO USE MY FORGE TO FIX IT. MY FORGE HAS GONE COLD. CAN YOU FIND A FIRE FLOWER FOR ME. THEY BLOOM IN THE FOREST.
THE AXE IS NOW FIXED.
THANK YOU FOR FIXING MY AXE. I WILL CUT THAT TREE DOWN BEFORE YOU GET THERE.
THANK YOU FOR GETTING MY TEDDY BEAR. I WILL OPEN THE DUNGEON FOR YOU. XYZZY!
YOU HAVE CONQUERED THE DUNGEON AND RETURNED MY SCEPTRE. YOU ARE NOW READY TO EXPLORE THE REST OF THE ISLAND.

DESERT GATEMASTER
I NEED A BOOK FROM THE LIBRARIAN TO OPEN THE DUNGEON GATE. I CAN OPEN THE GATE TO THE NORTH FOR YOU THOUGH.
I WILL BE HAPPY TO GET THE BOOK THAT THE DESERT GATEMASTER ASKED FOR, BUT IT WILL COST YOU. COLLECT THE 4 ORBS THAT ARE SCATTERED AROUND THE ISLAND AND THE BOOK IS YOURS.
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE ORBS NOW THAT YOU HAVE TALKED TO ME. PASSAGES ARE OPENING.
YOU DO NOT HAVE THE 4 ORBS YET, COME BACK WHEN YOU DO.
LIBRARIAN
YOU FOUND AN ORB
I WILL TAKE THOSE ORBS. THE LOUSY BOOK IS YOURS.
BWAHAHA! YOU FOOL, I NOW HAVE THE 4 ORBS OF POWER, NOTHING CAN STOP ME. GOOD THING I STOLE THE GOLDEN APPLE AND HID IT. I WILL NOW RULE THE ISLAND!
I CANNOT OPEN THE DUNGEONS WITHOUT THAT BOOK, I DO NOT REMEMBER THE MAGIC WORD.
OH MY! I HAD NO IDEA. THAT EXPLAINS WHY THE DUNGEONS OPENED AND THE MONSTERS SPEWED OUT. THAT IS WHY THE GATEMASTERS ARE KEEPING THEM CLOSED. 
WITH THE ORBS OF POWER I AM AFRAID THAT IT WILL BE HARD TO STOP HIM. I WILL OPEN THE DUNGEON FOR YOU. REZROV! THE DUNGEON IS NOW OPEN. COME SEE ME WHEN YOU COME OUT OF THE DUNGEON.
USE THAT RING TO CAPTURE THAT FROG FROM ANTHONY. SEEK THE WIZARD IN THE CASTLE, PERHAPS HE CAN HELP US ALL.
I AM THE ISLAND WIZARD. I HEARD ABOUT THE LIBRARIAN AND THE GOLDEN APPLE. CAN YOU FIND MY STAFF? IT GOT BROKEN IN HALF AND DISAPPEARED WHEN HE GOT THE ORBS OF POWER. 
I KNOW MY STAFF IS SOMEWHERE ON THE ISLAND. BRING THEM BACK TO ME AND I WILL BE ABLE TO OPEN ALL THE GATES. I CAN OPEN THE ROOM NORTH FOR YOU.
THE KEY TO UNLOCK THE NORTH GATE IS SOMEWHERE IN THIS CASTLE.
YOU FOUND HALF OF THE STAFF
PLEASE FIND THE OTHER HALF OF MY STAFF.
THANK YOU. I CAN NOW OPEN ALL THE GATES FOR YOU. PLUGH! THE GATES ARE NOW ALL OPEN.
